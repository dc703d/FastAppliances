                How do I know when it's time to repair or replace an appliance?
                <div className={`answer ${visibleAnswers[0] ? "visible" : ""}`}>
                    Deciding whether to repair or replace an appliance can
                    depend on several factors. Generally, if the repair cost is
                    more than 50% of the price of a new appliance, it might make
                    more financial sense to replace it. Age is another
                    considerationâ€”if your appliance is over 10 years old, it may
                    be nearing the end of its lifespan, and you could be looking
                    at more frequent repairs in the future.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Additionally, newer appliances tend to be more
                    energy-efficient, which can save you money on utility bills
                    over time. If your appliance has been unreliable or
                    frequently breaking down, replacing it may offer peace of
                    mind, knowing you're less likely to face similar issues
                    soon.

                How long does a typical repair take?
                <div className={`answer ${visibleAnswers[3] ? "visible" : ""}`}>
                    The length of time it takes to complete a repair can vary
                    depending on the complexity of the issue and the type of
                    appliance. For straightforward repairs, such as replacing a
                    belt on a washing machine or fixing a simple electrical
                    issue, the repair usually takes around 1-2 hours. However,
                    if we need to order specific parts or the appliance has
                    multiple issues that require attention, it could take
                    longer. <br />
                    <br />
                    Our technicians strive to diagnose the problem quickly and
                    give you a clear estimate of the time required as soon as
                    they inspect the appliance. In cases where parts need to be
                    ordered, we always try to expedite the process so that your
                    appliance is back in working order as soon as possible.
